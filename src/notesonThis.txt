this.title is global variable, and title is a local variable  
This is similar to this.title=flimtitle, but using this. prefix is not compulsary 
This is similar to this.director=flimdirector, but using this. prefix is not compulsary
as there are no local variables by name title, or director so, here they will implicitly referred to global variable
note: if title and director are not global declare then it will be undeclared variable cannot to be resolved to a variable
if the parameter names are similar to the global variables
then there is an ambiguity between the local variable (parameters) and global variable
hence this. prefix is used for referring the global variable
title=title will be referring the local variable on both side of the = operator (x=x) self assigning
